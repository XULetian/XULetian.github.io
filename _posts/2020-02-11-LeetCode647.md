### Problem Statement

[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)

Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

### Methods 1:

Greedy approach. The easiest one, and the complexity one with O(n^3).

### Approach:

#### Python

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countSubstrings(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        for i in xrange(len(s)):
            for j in xrange(i, len(s)):
                if s[i:j + 1] == s[i:j + 1][::-1]:
                    count += 1
        return count
```

### Methods 2:

Two pointer approach, and be careful with odd and even palindromic situation. For every iteration from the fro loop, we use while loop to testify all the potential odd number palindromic, such as 3, 5, 7... Then we go through the same thing but the even number palindromic. In the end we can just return the total number of count.

### Approach:

#### Python

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countSubstrings(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            count += 1
            
            # ODD Palindromic
            l = i-1
            r = i+1
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                count += 1
                l = l-1
                r = r+1
                
            # EVEN Palindromic
            l = i
            r = i+1
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                count += 1
                l = l-1
                r = r+1
                
        return count
```

### Methods 3:

Dynamic Programming: using the dp to record the information if the dp[i][j] is the palindromic, we can only discuss if the dp[i:j] is palindromic or not.

Since the size of palindromic was different, we can set three different parameter:

1. If it is single character, it is palindromic;

2. If they are two same character, they are palindromic;

3. If the head and tail of a string is the same, let's see if the middle part (dp[i+1][j-1]) is palindromic or not.

### Approach:

#### Python

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countSubstrings(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        N = len(s)
        dp = [[False] * N for _ in range(N)]
        for l in range(1, N + 1): 
            #l stands for the length of palindromic
            #Such as 'a' counts one length, 'aba' counts 3 length
            for i in range(N - l + 1):
                j = i + l - 1
                if l == 1 or (l == 2 and s[i] == s[j]) or (l >= 3 and s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]):
                    dp[i][j] = True
                    count += 1
        return count
```
