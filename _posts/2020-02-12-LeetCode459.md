### Problem Statement

[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/)

Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: "abab"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: "aba"
Output: False
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: "abcabcabcabc"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)
```

### Methods:

Just slice it and mutiple.

### Approach:

#### Python

```python
class Solution(object):
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        l = len(s)
        for i in range(1, l // 2 + 1):
            if l % i == 0:
                sub = s[:i]
                if sub * (l // i) == s:
                    return True
        return False
```

#### Java
